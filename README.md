# SwiftBuilder

Swift Builder is a plugin for gnome builder that adds support for swift via sourcekit lsp. To use it, ensure swift has been installed and is available in your path, and copy the .plugin and .py files to your gnome builder plugins directory; In my case, this is ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins
